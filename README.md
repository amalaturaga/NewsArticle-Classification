# Global University Ranking Analysis
Introduction to Statistical Programming - R

This final project consisted of two parts, the first using a dataset given to me by the course instructor and the second, using a dataset of my choosing to perform/obtain the summary statistics of each data set. Although the dataset used for the second portion was rather broad, only covering the global top 10 university rankings, I could still get usable summary statistics to understand the rankings in the first place.

Future Considerations: If I could alter/continue this project, I would add the rankings to create a dashboard showing top universities globally and by country. I would also add more information to explain why these rankings were given in the first place and organize the universities based on the metrics used to rank them.
